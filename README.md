👋 Hi, I’m junior manual tester starting my adventure with IT. I successfully completed a practical course at Software Development Academy and I'm preparing for the ISTQB exam.
  
👀 You can find here my projects, including final project for SDA Academy.
  
🌱 I’m still learning and I'm open to testing any website or application.
  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the field of manual testing.
